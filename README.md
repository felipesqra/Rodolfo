# :closed_book: Rodolfo
A class manager built with React Native and Realm.

## :question: About the project

The main goal of this project is to get us started in Javascript, React Native and Realm, so this is our first project using those three technologies combined. Rodolfo was created to be an offline application that helps you keep track of your grades and goals during the school season. Thus, you can store subjects, notes, grades and a main grade that is your average goal for that subject. Rodolfo will show you your current status in achieving that goal.

### :iphone: Here's a few snapshots of the app:
